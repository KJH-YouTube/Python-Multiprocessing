# Python Multiprocessing 1

## Introduction

This python-multiprocessing folder includes a basic grammar form for multiprocessing on a thread unit and some example files for it. A basic form, however, does not include `shared_memory` concept. For this, I will handle the method next time (when I can do that). If there is a folder with title ***Multiprocessing_2***. The included python files could be excuted by some commands. The execution command examples belong to `Execution` Section. 

## Purpose

For this program and video, I wanted those who want to study python multiprocessing (threading) to learn this topic and programming skills with more efficient methods. Actually, although there are many directions and methods to implement multiprocessing program with python multiprocessing built-in module, some applications and methods which are revealed by public were not almost good and efficient. Thus, I wanted to provide multiprocessing programming code design in python.

## Operation

The given files compute the summation of from one to `N`, an input command parameter. You can also determine how many cores of CPU you will activate (single or multicore).

## Execution

If following this command form, you can execute the computations on your desktop or laptop.
